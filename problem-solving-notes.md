| UVA 10368  | It was challenging, had a long time on how to get started, until the observations are made. O1: this question is highly related to GCD, so the question name "Euclid's Game" is indeed a big hint. O2: For a > b, if a / b >= 2, the player can choose to reduce b "at once", or just only reduce a b from a. O3: For each "reduce-b-operation", for example, 15 & 4, need two operations, one to 4 & 3, one to 3 & 1, we can use a number to represent it, based on O2, the number can only be 1 or 2(if op count > 1). O4: Once we have all the operation, we can walk through the very last operation to very first to check whether the player can win. |
