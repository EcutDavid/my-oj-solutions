Repo for my accepted solutions in online coding judgment platforms like [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/), [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

## The Counter
Codeforces: 24 problems solved  
SPOJ: 13 problems solved  

## Notes
26/10/2018: switched from spoj to codeforces due to it's more suited for me
  1. More clear about problems diffcuties.
  1. The ranking is more useful, not strongly effected by how long a person has been using the platform).

27/10/2018: made `./publish.go` for fun and encouraging.
