Repo for my accepted solutions in online coding judgment platforms like [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/), [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

## The Counter
Codeforces: 29 problems solved  
SPOJ: 13 problems solved  
Code Jam: 2 problems solved  

## Notes
26/10/2018: switched from spoj to codeforces due to it's more suited for me
  1. More clear about problems diffcuties.
  1. The ranking is more useful, not strongly effected by how long a person has been using the platform).

27/10/2018: made `./publish.go` for fun and encouraging.

20/11/2018: when it comes to big input for example https://codeforces.com/contest/1062/problem/C, which has a text token that is 10^5 long, use https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#NewReaderSize instead of scanner(which has a smaller buffer), more context is in this [stack overflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21124327/how-to-read-a-text-file-line-by-line-in-go-when-some-lines-are-long-enough-to-ca)

22/11/2018: made https://github.com/EcutDavid/codeforces-validator for testing basic cases quickly without copy & paste.
