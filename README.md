Repo for my accepted solutions in online coding judgment platforms like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/) and [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/).

## Project Euler
I'm also working on solving Project Euler problems on hackerrank.
Why not projecteuler.net?
* Hackerrank get hidden test cases, reducing the possibility of "a broken solution but happen to produce correct answer for a single test case"(projecteuler.net has one test case per problem).
* Hackerrank, as many other OJ platform, has a time limitation, which provides the incentive for producing low time-complexity solutions.

Here is the process: https://www.hackerrank.com/results/projecteuler/davidguandev

It's mentioned in projecteuler.net that anyone should not open source their solution(so I'm not open source the solutions here), if you interested in my solutions, plz talk to me privately, I can send them to you but plz don't open source them :)

## The Counter
Codeforces: 107 problems solved  
SPOJ: 13 problems solved  
Code Jam: 5 problems solved  

## Notes
27/10/2018: made `./publish.go` for fun and encouraging.

20/11/2018: when it comes to big input, for example https://codeforces.com/contest/1062/problem/C, which has a text token that is 10^5 long, use https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#NewReaderSize instead of the scanner(which has a smaller buffer), more context is in this [stack overflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21124327/how-to-read-a-text-file-line-by-line-in-go-when-some-lines-are-long-enough-to-ca)

22/11/2018: made https://github.com/EcutDavid/codeforces-validator for testing basic cases quickly without copy & paste.

25/11/2018: add [marked-and-then-solved.md](https://github.com/EcutDavid/oj-solutions-go/blob/master/marked-and-then-solved.md) for problems that I had fight hard.

19/1/2019: add [marked-and-then-solved.md](https://github.com/EcutDavid/my-oj-solutions/blob/master/problem-solving-notes.md) as the central place to take notes, instead of taking notes inside solutions, for easier later-stage-compare, also, started using C++.
