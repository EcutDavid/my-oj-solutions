## Notes
27/10/2018: made `./publish.go` for fun and encouraging.

20/11/2018: when it comes to big input, for example https://codeforces.com/contest/1062/problem/C, which has a text token that is 10^5 long, use https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#NewReaderSize instead of scanner(which has a smaller buffer), more context is in this [stack overflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21124327/how-to-read-a-text-file-line-by-line-in-go-when-some-lines-are-long-enough-to-ca)

22/11/2018: made https://github.com/EcutDavid/codeforces-validator for testing basic cases quickly without copy & paste.

25/11/2018: add [marked-and-then-solved.md](https://github.com/EcutDavid/oj-solutions-go/blob/master/marked-and-then-solved.md) for problems that I fight hard.
